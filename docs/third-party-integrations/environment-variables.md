# Adding Third-Party Integrations with KEYBOARD Environment Variables

## Overview

Environment variables are crucial for configuring and customizing code execution in the KEYBOARD development ecosystem. This guide will help you understand how to add and manage environment variables in GitHub Codespaces for the KEYBOARD project.

## Why Environment Variables Matter

Environment variables provide a secure and flexible way to:
- Configure sensitive credentials
- Set runtime configurations
- Enable third-party integrations
- Maintain flexible code across different environments

## Adding Environment Variables in GitHub Codespaces

### Step 1: Accessing Codespace Settings

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the 'Code' dropdown
3. Select 'Create codespace on main'

### Step 2: Setting Environment Variables

You can set environment variables through two primary methods:

#### Method 1: GitHub Codespaces Repository Settings
- Go to Repository Settings
- Select 'Codespaces'
- Add variables in the 'Repository secrets' section

#### Method 2: .env File
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Naming Convention: Use Descriptive, Uppercase Names
KEYBOARD_INTEGRATION_API_KEY=your_secret_key
KEYBOARD_THIRD_PARTY_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
```

## Best Practices for Environment Variable Naming

✅ Do:
- Use descriptive, uppercase names
- Prefix with project or integration name
- Be specific about the variable's purpose

❌ Avoid:
- Generic names like `KEY` or `SECRET`
- Lowercase or mixed-case names
- Ambiguous abbreviations

### Examples of Good Environment Variable Names

```bash
# Excellent: Clear, Specific, Descriptive
KEYBOARD_OPENAI_API_KEY
KEYBOARD_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
KEYBOARD_INTEGRATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Environment variables can contain sensitive information. Always follow these guidelines:
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use GitHub's secret management features
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Limit access to environment variables

## Discretionary Use Warning

**Disclaimer**: Environment variables should be used with careful consideration and judgment. Always:
- Understand the potential security implications
- Verify the source and purpose of each variable
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly audit and review your environment configurations

## Conclusion

Properly managed environment variables are key to creating flexible, secure, and maintainable code integrations in the KEYBOARD development ecosystem.

## Next Steps
- Review your current environment variable strategy
- Implement descriptive naming conventions
- Audit and secure your integration configurations
